This is a mirror/archive of the source code of [HamClock](https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock), primarily intended for use in maintaining the AUR packages.

* HamClock's update system is disabled in the AUR packages (but *not* in this repo). This is intentional.
* If you have a problem with HamClock itself, and it is not related to updates, see the link above.
* Please do not submit pull requests to this repo.
* Please note that this repo and the AUR packages should rarely be out of date by more than a couple days. If they are, it most likely means we're on vacation and I either didn't take my laptop or do not have Internet access, and issues and flags will not do any good.
